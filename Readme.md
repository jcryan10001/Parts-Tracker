This Blazor .NET 6.0 application is built with a back-end database that stores and manages all the part-related data. The front-end of the application is built using Blazor, which enables developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces using C# and HTML.

The database is designed to efficiently store and manage data related to parts inventory, order management, part usage tracking, and part treatment tracking. The database enables the application to easily search, retrieve, and update data, as well as perform complex queries to generate reports and analytics.

The Blazor front-end is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, with interactive UI elements and real-time updates. The application is built with responsive design principles, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
